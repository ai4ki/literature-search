Text: According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, demographic change is the most important indirect driver of changing biodiversity. The underlying mechanism involves an alteration of land use patterns through demographic developments. Consequently, anthropogenic land use changes are the primary cause of changes in ecosystems and related species. So far, human population growth and urbanisation are considered the most important and dominant demographic developments. There is, however, spatial and temporal non-simultaneity of varying demographic processes, especially on different scalesâ€”global, regional, and local. Robust knowledge about the effects of demographic change on biodiversity is scarce. To date, changes in the size and density of human population and their effects on ecosystems and species diversity have mainly been discussed with a focus on their supposed negative impact. However, it has been shown that this supposition cannot be generalised; the aggregated representation of human population dynamics cannot explain the correlations sufficiently. In fact, demographic change is a complex interaction of many different processes. It entails not only increasing densities and growing human populations but also shrinking populations, changes in the age and gender structure, migration movements, and socio-economic changes.
