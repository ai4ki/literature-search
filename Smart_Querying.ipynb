    "### (A)  The fast, efficient, and solid way: statistical keyword extraction\n",
    "For extracting relevant keywords from your text, we use the method described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025519308588?via%3Dihub) and documented [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this method doesn't select for different parts of speech (but it also doesn't return stopwords). However, we found that using only proper nouns, nouns, and verbs yields better search strings. As a default setting, therefore, we discard all other types of words, except when they appear in a multi-term keyword (that is, an n-gram with n>1). If you want to override this setting, change the paramter `org_kw`to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After keyword extraction, we apply the following simple recipe to cook up a Boolean search string: We chain the first `top_k` keywords together with the AND-operator, concatenate the remaining terms with the OR-operator, and link up the two resulting expressions with 'AND'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsatisfied with the result, try adjusting the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `num_keywords`: maximum number of keywords to extract\n",
    "- `ngram_limit`: maximum number of terms in a keyword\n",
    "- `dedup_value`: [0,1], controls repetition of words in keyword list (only relevant, when `ngram_limit>1`); set it low to reduce repetions; we found that a value of 0.3 yields good results (note that low values may result in less keywords overall)\n",
